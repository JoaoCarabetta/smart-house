# Smart House

This project will use a combination of Home Assistant(https://home-assistant.io/) and Arduino (https://www.arduino.cc) to automate the house.

We have three modules in mind. One to put on the sockets, other to control the lights and the last one to water our small garden. 

Here is a plan of action:
1. Set up the Home Assistant with the Wi-Fi
2. Control the Arduino with the Home Assistant via Wi-Fi
3. Build each module separately 
4. Improve the modules
5. Build a box to each module
6. Buy Chinese componets and install the modules across the house
